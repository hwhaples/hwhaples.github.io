Originally from Greenbelt, Maryland, I graduated from the Science and Technology Program at Eleanor Roosevelt High School in 2017. Currently, I am an undergraduate general engineering major at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/), an elite STEM liberal arts college in Claremont, California.

My academic focus has been at the intersection of core chemical engineering and industrial management. In summer 2019, as a recipient of the [Riggs Fellowship for Engineering Management](paper_competition.pdf), I spearheaded complete factory floor renovations at two companies: Ametek Ameron and Mission Rubber.

In the spring of 2020, I designed a deployed a novel Halon 1301 distillation system with a team of fellow undergraduate engineers for the corporate liason, Ametek Ameron.

Most recently, as a recipient of the Lewis Fellowship for Engineering Professional Practice, I have performed materials science and seperation systems research with the Molecular Diffusion Laboratory at Harvey Mudd College. Through this work, I have completed coarse-grained molucular dynamics simulations of neat and nanocomposite polymers to better understand anomalous permeability and selectivity behavior first recorded by [T.C. Merkel et al.](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1069580)
