# Question 9.12
A vapor-compression refrigeration system is conventional except that a countercurrent heat exchanger is installed to subcool the liquid from the condenser by heat exchange with the vapor stream from the evaporator. The minimum temperature difference for heat transfer is 5°C. Tetrafluoroethane is the refrigerant (Table 9.1, Fig.F.2), evaporating at −6°C and condensing at 26°C. The heat load on the evaporator is 2000 kJ·s−1. If the compressor efficiency is 75%, what is the power requirement? How does this result compare with the power required by the compressor if the system operates without the heat exchanger? How do the refrigerant circulation rates compare for the two cases?

# Question 9.14
A heat pump is used to heat a house in the winter and to cool it in the summer. During the winter, the outside air serves as a low-temperature heat source; during the summer, it acts as a high-temperature heat sink. The heat-transfer rate through the walls and roof of the house is 0.75 kJ⋅s−1 for each °C of temperature difference between the inside and outside of the house, summer and winter. The heat-pump motor is rated at 1.5 kW. Determine the minimum outside temperature for which the house can be maintained at 20°C during the winter and the maximum outside temperature for which the house can be maintained at 25°C during the summer.

# Question 16.5
Make a thermodynamic analysis of the refrigeration cycle described in one of the
parts of Prob. 9.9. Assume that the refrigeration effect maintains a heat reservoir at a temperature 5°C above the evaporation temperature and that Tσ is 5°C below the condensation temperature.
