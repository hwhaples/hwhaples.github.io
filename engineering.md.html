Below you can find files and other information relating the engineering classes I have taken and (to come) engineering projects I have completed. Have fun and I hope you can learn a lot! Happy tinkering.

# Advanced Engineering Thermodynamics (E134)
The list below has markdeep versions of homework assignments 7 - 10 of the course. Please let me know if you find errors. Feel free to copy or print the files for your own use!

    - [Problem Set 7](hw7_E134.md.html)
    - [Problem Set 8](hw8_E134.md.html)
    - [Problem Set 9](hw9_E134.md.html)
    - [Problem Set 10](hw10_E134.md.html)

# Intro to Computer Engineering ([E85](e85.md.html))
This class teaches the fundamentals of Computer Engineering. Lifted directly from the course syllabus from Spring 2020, the goals of the class are to:

    - Build digital systems at all levels of abstraction from transistors through circuits, logic, microarchitecture, architecture, and C culminating with implementing and programming a microprocessor soft core on a field programmable gate array.
    - Manage complexity using the digital abstraction, data types, static and dynamic disciplines, and hierarchical design
    - Design and implement combinational and sequential digital circuits using schematics and hardware description languages.
    - Program a commercial microcontroller in C and assembly language and use it in a physical system.
    - Begin the practice of implementing and debugging digital systems with appropriate lab techniques including breadboarding, interpreting datasheets, and using field-programmable gate arrays and microcontroller boards, simulators, debuggers, and test-and-measurement equipment.

A plan for self studying the course is based off of the lecture and course material from the [website of Prof. David Harris](http://pages.hmc.edu/harris/class/e85/). The full self study plan designed for the Summer of 2020 is avaliable [here](e85.md.html).

# Continuum Mechanics ([E83](e83.md.html))
Continuum mechanics is a statics physics class interested in giving students a toolbox for understanding how to analyze the mechanical response of static systems. The overall course goals are below and an outline can be found on the course page [here](e83.md.html)

    - Draw and analyze static systems using free body diagrams and extending analysis to complex structures such as trusses.
    - Understand and systematically calculate the tension, compression, and shear forces acting on a static system.
    - Apply force analysis to axial loads, twists, and torsions.
    - Introduce plane stress and plane stress transformation in order to analyze the stresses on a system element in any 2D orientation.
    - Solve loaded beam problems by analyzing loads, shear forces, and bending moments to determine beam deflection.
    - Introduce hydrostatics and forces applied on submerged objects.
