# Question 13.8
Do all four parts of Prob. 13.7, and compare the results. The required temperatures and pressures vary significantly. Discuss possible processing implications of the various temperature and pressure levels.

A single-stage liquid/vapor separation for the benzene(1)/ethylbenzene(2) system must produce phases of the following equilibrium compositions. For one of these sets, determine T and P in the separator. What additional information is needed to compute the relative amounts of liquid and vapor leaving the separator? Assume that Raoult’s law applies.

    - $ x_1 = 0.35, y_1 = 0.70. $
    - $ x_1 = 0.35, y_1 = 0.725. $
    - $ x_1 = 0.35, y_1 = 0.75. $
    - $ x_1 = 0.35, y_1 = 0.7775. $

# Question 13.10
Do all four parts of Prob. 13.9, and compare the results. Discuss any trends that appear.

A mixture containing equimolar amounts of benzene(1), toluene(2), and ethylbenzene(3) is flashed to conditions T and P. For one of the following conditions, determine the equilibrium mole fractions $ {x_i} $ and $ {y_i} $ of the liquid and vapor phases formed and the molar fraction of the vapor formed. Assume that Raoult’s law applies.

    - T = 110°C, P = 90 kPa.
    - T = 110°C, P = 100 kPa. 
    - T = 110°C, P = 110 kPa. 
    - T = 110°C, P = 120 kPa.

# Question 13.12
Humidity, relating to the quantity of moisture in atmospheric air, is accurately given by equations derived from the ideal-gas law and Raoult’s law for H2O.

    - The absolute humidity h is defined as the mass of water vapor in a unit mass of dry air. Show that it is given by:
    \begin{equation}
    h = \frac{ℳ_{H_2O}}{ℳ_{air}} \frac{p_{h_2O}}{P - p_{H_2O}}
    \end{equation}
    
    where ℳ represents a molar mass and pH2O is the partial pressure of the water vapor, i.e., $ p_{H_2O} = y_{H_2O} P $ . 

    - The saturation humidity hsat is defined as the value of h when air is in equilibrium with a large body of pure water. Show that it is given by:
    \begin{equation}
    h_{sat} = \frac{ℳ_{H_2O}}{ℳ_{air}} \frac{p_{H_2O}^{sat}}{P - p_{H_2O}^{sat}}
    \end{equation}
    where pH2O sat  is the vapor pressure of water at the ambient temperature. 

    - The percentage humidity is defined as the ratio of h to its saturation value,expressed as a percentage. On the other hand, the relative humidity is defined as the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor in air to its vapor pressure,expressed as a percentage. What is the relation between these two quantities?
