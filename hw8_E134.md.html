# Question 16.1
A plant takes in water at 21°C, cools it to 0°C, and freezes it at this temperature, producing $ 0.5\, kg·s^{−1} $ of ice. Heat rejection is at 21°C. The heat of fusion of water is $ 333.5\, kJ·kg^{−1} $ .
    
    - What is $ \dot{W}_{ideal} $ for the process?
    - What is the power requirement of a single Carnot heat pump operating between 0 and 21°C? What is the thermodynamic efficiency of this process? What is its irreversible feature?
    - What is the power requirement if an ideal tetrafluoroethane vapor-compression refrigeration cycle is used? Ideal here implies isentropic compression, infinite cooling-water rate in the condenser, and minimum heat-transfer driving forces in evaporator and condenser of 0°C. What is the thermodynamic efficiency of this process? What are its irreversible features?
    - What is the power requirement of a tetrafluoroethane vapor-compression cycle for which the compressor efficiency is 75%, the minimum temperature differences in evaporator and condenser are 5°C, and the temperature rise of the cooling water in the condenser is 10°C? Make a thermodynamic analysis of this process.
