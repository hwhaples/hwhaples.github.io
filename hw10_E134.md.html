# Question 10.14
For a particular binary liquid solution at constant T and P, the molar enthalpies of mixtures are represented by the equation:

\begin{equation}
    H = x_1 (a_1 + b_1 x_1) + x_2 (a_2 + b_2 x_2)
\end{equation}

where the $ a_i $ and $ b_i $ are constants. Because the equation has the form of Eq. (10.11), it might be that $ \bar{H}_i = a_i + b_i x_i $ . Show whether this is true.

# Question 13.17
For the system ethyl ethanoate(1)/n-heptane(2) at 343.15 K, $ \ln{\gamma_1} = 0.95 x_2^2; \ln{\gamma_2} = 0.95 x_1^2; $ $ P_1^{sat} $ = 79.80 kPa $ P_2^{sat} $ = 40.50 kPa. Assuming the validity of Eq. (13.19),

    - Make a BUBL P calculation for T = 343.15 K, $ x_1 $ = 0.05.
    - Make a DEW P calculation for T = 343.15 K, $ y_1 $ = 0.05.
    - What are the azeotrope composition and pressure at T = 343.15 K?

# Question 10.16
From the following compressibility-factor data for CO2 at 150Â°C,  prepare plots of
the fugacity and fugacity coefficient of CO2 vs. P for pressures up to 500 bar.
Compare results with those found from the generalized correlation represented by
Eq. (10.68).

P/bar  | Z 
-------|------
   10  |  0.985   
   20  |  0.970  
   40  |  0.942
   60  |  0.913
   80  |  0.885
   100 |  0.869
   200 |  0.765
   300 |  0.762
   400 |  0.824
   500 |  0.910

# Question 13.49
For Ethanol(1)/Toluene(2) listed in Table 13.10, based on Eq. (13.19) and the
Wilson equation, make the following calculations:

    - BUBLT: P = 101.33 kPa, $ x_1 $ = 0.3
    - DEW T: P = 101.33 kPa, $ y_1 $ = 0.3
    - P,T - flash: P = 101.33 kPa, T = $ \frac{1}{2} (T_{bubble} + T_{dew}) $ , $ z_{1} $ = 0.3. 
    - If an azeotrope exists at P = 101.33 kPa, find $ T^{az} $ and $ x_1^{az} = y_1^{az} $.
