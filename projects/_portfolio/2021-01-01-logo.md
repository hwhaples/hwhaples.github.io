title: What's That Logo?
---

When I began transitioning my personal website from its barebones Markdeep iteration to the more eye-friendly Jekyll template, one of the things I really wanted to change was the personal logo favicon. For years I had used a design I made almost 10 years ago that, looking back, I believe was once fitting but fails to capture how much I have changed over that time.

I used this logo for quite a long time, but its orginal purpose was for my first YouTube channel. I orginally planned to jump on the Podcasting fad from several years ago, but found far more luck with juggling videos. Although the channel has been long abandoned (student work caught up to me), the videos are still up at [HNWpodcasts](https://www.youtube.com/user/HNWpodcasts)

But with the new website, I thought it fit to make a new logo that was more relevant to my professional interests. After a while of tinkering, I settled on this seemingly abstract design.

<img src="/image/logo.png" class="center">

In the center, as an abstract H, representing my first name. However, the prominent outline represents my growth as a chemical engineer with a clear pump at the top and turbine at the bottom. The rectangles on either side depict a boiler and condenser.

For the uninitiated, together the diagram shows a Rankine cycle, the thermodynamic cycle that I studied for the first time as a sophomore in thermodynamics. Since then I've held this cycle in my heart as the moment I decided to study ChemE, and thought it only fitting for my personal "brand."
