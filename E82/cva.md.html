# Nozzles
What is a nozzle, and what does it do? How can I use thermodynamics to model nozzles?

## Background
A nozzle is a common and simple everyday device that I’m sure you have interacted with before. In the most general sense, a nozzle changes the direction or characteristics of a fluid flow – normally velocity – as it enters or exits a vessel or pipe.

Most commonly a nozzle is a tube or pipe of varying cross-sectional area. Narrowing or widening the pipe can control flow rate, speed, direction, mass flow, shape, or pressure of the stream that emerges. When you think of a nozzle think of the end of hose which accelerates the water to much faster speeds than how it travels inside the hose.

Since energy is conserved, this increased velocity comes as a result of a pressure drop across the nozzle. On a flow diagram, a nozzle looks like:

A nozzle that has a larger opening at entrance than at exit is known as a diffuser.

## Example Problem: Isentropic Nozzle
Steam enters a nozzle at 3000 kPa and 450 C at negligible velocity and discharges at a pressure of 2400 kPa. If we imagine that the expansion is isentropic, what is the exit velocity and what is the cross-sectional area at the nozzle throat for a flow rate of 1 kg/s?
____________________________
First, make some common assumptions about nozzles:

    - Due to the high velocity of fluid, there is no heat transfer, **Q = 0**
    - There is no shaft motion or current, **W = 0**
    - Elevation changes are negligible, $ \Delta PE $
    - Mass at the inlet equals mass at the outlet, $ m_{1} = m_{2} $

Begin with the first law of thermodynamics:

$$ Q + W = m (\Delta h +  \Delta \frac{v^{2}}{2} + \Delta g z )$$

Applying the assumptions above, this simplifies quite a bit to:

$$ H_{1} + \frac{v_{1}^{2}}{2} = H_{2} + \frac{v_{2}^{2}}{2} $$

If $ V_{1} = 0 $ , as stated by the problem statement, then this can reduced down to:

$$ H_{1} = H_{2} + \frac{v_{2}^{2}}{2} $$

Using a [steam table](E82/E82_code/ThermodynamicTablesExcel.xlsx), we can extract the following values. **What property gives us a second look up value for the outlet, Pressure and ... ?**

Inlet             |                | Outlet           |              |
------------------|----------------|------------------|--------------|
T (C)             | 450            | T(C)             | 414.6        |
P (kPa)           | 3000           | P (kPa)          | 2.4          |
v ($m^{2}$ / kg)  | 0.1079         | v ($m^{2}$ / kg) | 0.1284       |
H (kJ / kg)       | 3344           | H (kJ / kg)      | 3274         |
S (kJ / kg K)     | 7.083          | S (kJ / kg K)    | 7.083        |

Solving the above equation for velocity, we can see:

$$ V_{2} = \sqrt{2 (H_{1} - H_{2})} = 374 m/s $$ 

Since the mass flow rate at inlet and outlet must be equal - no accumulation in the nozzle - we can solve for cross-sectional area with the following relation to density.

$$ m_{1} = m_{2} = \frac{A_{2} V_{2}}{v_{2}} $$

We find that the area must be $ 3.43 cm^{2} $. Be sure to check your units!
