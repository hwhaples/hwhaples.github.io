This repository contains the source code supporting the personal website [hwhaples.com](https://hwhaples.com). This website is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and built using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) framework.

The original template for this website was called [celeste](https://nicoelayda.github.io/celeste). This template has been heavily modified to fit personal content. The celeste template is working in tandem with [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) to produce beautiful webpages. The original celeste markdown README remains below.

# celeste

Celeste is a lightweight Jekyll theme that features a minimalist, content-first design. It places your content center stage and lets your readers view them in a clutter-free environment without visual distractions. It is based on [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), the Jekyll butler, by [@mdo](https://github.com/mdo).
