    Originally from Greenbelt, Maryland, I graduated from the Science and Technology Program at Eleanor Roosevelt High School in 2017. Currently, I am an undergraduate general engineering major at <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/"">Harvey Mudd College</a>, an elite STEM liberal arts college in Claremont, California.

    <p>
    My academic focus has been at the intersection of core chemical engineering and industrial management. In summer 2019, as a recipient of the <a href="paper_competition.pdf">Riggs Fellowship for Engineering Management</a>, I spearheaded complete factory floor renovations at two companies: Ametek Ameron and Mission Rubber.

    In the spring of 2020, I designed and deployed a novel Halon 1301 distillation system with a team of fellow undergraduate engineers for the corporate liaison, Ametek Ameron.

    Most recently, as a recipient of the Lewis Fellowship for Engineering Professional Practice, I have performed materials science and separation systems research with the Molecular Diffusion Laboratory at Harvey Mudd College. Through this work, I have completed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of neat and nanocomposite polymers to better understand anomalous permeability and selectivity behavior first recorded by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1069580">T.C. Merkel et al.</a>

      Currently, I am working for <a href="https://www.meepanyar.com/">Mee Panyar</a>, a social enterprise in Myanmmar working to bring solar electricity to the country's rural villages. I am applying by background and machine learning and data analytics to build an anomaly detection MVP in order to improve system reliability.
